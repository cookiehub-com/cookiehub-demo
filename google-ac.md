# What is TCF ?
IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) has a simple objective to help all parties in the digital advertising chain ensure that they comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive when processing personal data or accessing and/or storing information on a user’s device, such as cookies, advertising identifiers, device identifiers and other tracking technologies. IAB Tech Lab stewards the development of these technical specifications.

# What is Google's Additional Consent Mode

Google's Additional Consent Mode is intended only for use alongside IAB Europe’s Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) v2.0 to serve as a bridge for vendors who are not yet registered on the IAB Europe Global Vendor List (GVL).
